## Reporting a Vulnerability

The safety and security of our project is our top priority. If you have discovered a potential security vulnerability in the DNS Security Analysis Tool, we kindly ask you to report it to us responsibly.

Please send your report to sohag.shamim@gmail.com with the following details:

- Description of the vulnerability and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept
- Any other relevant information

We will review your report and work to understand and resolve the issue as swiftly as possible. Please refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until a fix has been issued.
